# ðŸ“… Day 1: Data Visualization in Power BI

### **Overview**
On my first day, I focused on understanding and visualizing data through Power BI. Here's a detailed summary of the process and accomplishments:

### **Steps Completed**

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Acquired the extended_compressor_data_with_timestamp dataset.
   - Fixed issues with the `timestamp` field to ensure accuracy and proper formatting.

2. **Data Enhancement**:
   - Created additional calculated fields to enrich the dataset and support advanced analysis.

3. **Visualization in Power BI**:
   - Designed and implemented several charts to visually represent the data and identify key patterns.

This marks the starting point of an exciting journey in mastering data visualization and analytics.

### **Dashboard Details**

1. **Total Records:**
   - Displayed the total number of records to provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset size.

2. **Compressor Status Overview:**
   - Designed a **donut chart** to present the overall status of the compressor in a visually appealing and concise manner.

3. **Input vs. Output Parameters:**
   - Created **scatter plots** to map:
     - Input heat to output heat.
     - Input pressure to output pressure.

4. **Fuel Consumption vs. Efficiency:**
   - Designed another **scatter plot** to represent the relationship between fuel consumption and efficiency.

5. **Average Efficiency Overview:**
   - Incorporated a **gauge chart** to display the average efficiency for a quick and clear understanding.

6. **Fuel Quality Analysis:**
   - Grouped fuel quality into 2-unit bins and visualized the data using a **pie chart** to provide an overview of fuel quality distribution.

7. **Cumulative Efficiency Over Time:**
   - Developed an **area chart** to display cumulative efficiency over time:
     - Initially aggregated by date.
     - Interactive feature: Clicking on a specific day reveals detailed data for that day.

8. **Environment Temperature and Humidity:**
   - Designed a **line chart** with time-based granularity similar to the area chart, showing both environmental temperature and humidity simultaneously.

9. **Load Factor Analysis:**
   - Created a **stacked column chart** with a time-based structure to visualize all load factors comprehensively.

10. **Efficiency and Fuel Consumption:**
    - Implemented a **line and stacked column chart** to display efficiency and fuel consumption simultaneously:
      - Columns for efficiency, categorized by fuel quality bins.
      - A line for fuel consumption trends.
